<h3>Best Ever Rich Spaghetti Bolognese</h4>

<p>Spaghetti Bolognese was one of the first dishes I ever cooked for myself and it is a dish that we as a family never get bored of.

    Whenever I make it, I often make double the amount and then turn it into a Chilli the next day just for variation. Saves on time and it makes a great base to a chilli.
    
    You just can add in the spices for the chilli, some peppers, fresh jalapeno and kidney beans and you have a perfect rich chilli that can be ready in less than 20 mins. Perfect!!</p>

    </li>
    <li>When the meat mixture is almost ready, add the pasta to a large saucepan of salted boiling hot water and cook to al dente. Reserve approx 80ml (â…“ cup) of the pasta water, then drain.
